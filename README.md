## What It Does?
Net Finder Allows you to find the position of the current access point using only the signal strength

## How can you use it
All you need to do is download the zip and install all dependencies. In the folder directory, run `npm install` to install node dependencies and you will also need to install python dependencies using `pip install`.
After that, you will need to run the `server.js` file using node and the `apiserver.py` using python.
Then head to `127.0.0.1:3000` or `localhost:3000` in your browser.

Note: This project currently only supports Linux due to the nature of how we obtain the signal strength. Further OS support is in the works.
